## üß∞ Getting Started

>  We are using the backend from the OpenManus open source project.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The backend is not fully functional at the moment. Please explore the `projectomclient` folder only and start contributing to this part.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xAGI-labs/ProjectOM.git
cd projectomclient
```

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
cd projectomclient
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `projectomclient` folder with the following:

```env
DATABASE_URL="your_postgres_url"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_claude_api_key"

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your_clerk_publishable_key"
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="your_clerk_secret_key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL="/sign-in"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL="/sign-up"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL="/"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL="/"
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your_clerk_webhook_secret"
```

Make sure your PostgreSQL instance is running locally or in the cloud and the `DATABASE_URL` is properly set.

---

### 4. Set Up Database

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

To explore the database visually:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

---

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to:  
http://localhost:3000

---

## üß™ Running the Python Backend (Optional)

Only required if you're planning to use or extend the Python backend.

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

---

## üåç Deployment

You can easily deploy this using platforms like:

- **Frontend**: Vercel
- **Backend**: Render, Fly.io, or Docker

Make sure all your environment variables are properly set in the deployment platform settings.
